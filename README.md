# 91-514-f16-project
Project for 91.514 Internet and Web Systems II, Spring 2016

This project includes tools to integrate twitter, news, video and simple analytics with the open source project Weave (www.iweave.com). The included demo contains data from the 2015-2016 NBA season showcasing the top players in the league. Semi-structured data from twitter and various news sources is displayed alongside structured data. Interaction is coordinated between the visualizations (using weavejs libraries) and twitter/news tools (my novel contribution). When a user selects any of the structured data, relevent twitter and news stories are displayed to the user. In addition to these tools, I have utilized the alchemyAPI (http://www.alchemyapi.com/) powered by IBM's watson, to incorporate sentiment analysis of the included news articles.
